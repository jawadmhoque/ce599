    "### Background (from Mesa example)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Schelling (1971) segregation model is a classic of agent-based modeling, demonstrating how agents following simple rules lead to the emergence of qualitatively different macro-level outcomes. Agents are randomly placed on a grid. There are two types of agents, one constituting the majority and the other the minority. All agents want a certain number (generally, 3) of their 8 surrounding neighbors to be of the same type in order for them to be happy. Unhappy agents will move to a random available grid space. While individual agents do not have a preference for a segregated outcome (e.g. they would be happy with 3 similar neighbors and 5 different ones), the aggregate outcome is nevertheless heavily segregated.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Schelling used pennies and nickels to test his model.  We are going to implement this in python.  As discussed last time, agents can be naturally represented as objects.  I've started a class for you called SchellingAgent.  Take a look.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to notice are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Agents usually have a state.  What is represents the state of a SchellingAgent?  \n",
    "2. Agents usually know something about their environment.  What represents the environment in this case?  \n",
    "3. Agents usually have some autonomous behavior.  What behavior do they have?  \n"

First you understand big-picture what your code needs to do, and outline the methods.  Only after you get the signatures and basics set up, do you dive into the details of how to make them do those things.  This is a way to avoid getting lost in the weeds too soon.

If the bystander witnesses an inappropriate remark, either on themselves or on another agent, the intervener confronts the attacker.  Say there is a 10% chance that this intervention causes the attacker to stop making inappropriate remarks.  How would this change the simulation?  \n",

For each mean/selfish interaction in the simulation, the person on the receiving end has an increased proability of making a mean/selfish interaction with another co-worker.  What would happen in this simulation?  \n",
